    <h2 class="subheading5">ABOUT ISRO</h2>
    <img class="imaghis" src="images/history.jpg" height="500px" width="100%" />
    <h5 class="p5">
      India decided to go to space when Indian National Committee for Space
      Research (INCOSPAR) was set up by the Government of India in 1962. With
      the visionary Dr Vikram Sarabhai at its helm, INCOSPAR set up the Thumba
      Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in Thiruvananthapuram for
      upper atmospheric research. Indian Space Research Organisation, formed in
      1969, superseded the erstwhile INCOSPAR. Vikram Sarabhai, having
      identified the role and importance of space technology in a Nation's
      development, provided ISRO the necessary direction to function as an agent
      of development. ISRO then embarked on its mission to provide the Nation
      space based services and to develop the technologies to achieve the same
      independently.
